      <h1>A visual exploration of automobile dominance in Minneapolis with strategies to return power to pedestrians by way of graphic and urban design.
      </h1>
      <p>
        The vast majority of Minneapolis streets are dominated by car traffic and are unsafe for pedestrian life. This vehicular dominance has been normalized on our urban corridors and needs disrupting. That said, many residents are unsure of how to advocate for their neighborhoods and what design strategies are available beyond lowering speed limits. This publication equips urban residents of Minneapolis with knowledge of data, traffic calming strategies, and resources for advocating for people-first infrastructure on their local streets in order to create future streetscapes that benefit all users.
